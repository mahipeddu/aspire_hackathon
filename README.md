# From Model to Production: LLM Optimization & Deployment

This repository outlines a project to take a Large Language Model (LLM) from prototype to production. The focus is on **model optimization** through quantization and **building a secure, scalable, and observable service** around it.

## Project Goals

- **Model Optimization:** Apply quantization techniques (8-bit, 4-bit) to open-source LLMs to reduce size and computational cost while maintaining performance.  
- **Production-Ready Service:** Wrap the optimized model in a REST API with security, scalability, and observability features.  

## Key Components

- **Security:** Input validation, API key authentication, rate limiting, and prompt injection mitigation.  
- **Scalability:** Dockerized, stateless architecture suitable for horizontal scaling.  
- **Observability:** Structured logging and metrics collection (Prometheus-compatible).  

## Planned Tech Stack

- **ML Libraries:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Quantization Tools:** bitsandbytes, AutoGPTQ, ctransformers  
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana  

This repository will contain scripts, benchmarks, and documentation as the project progresses, showing the journey from a Jupyter notebook prototype to a production-grade LLM service.
